    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      For a recipe with so few ingredients (cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour
      cream, vanilla & salt), it took a lot longer than you might think to
      develop the perfect version. I’ve shared a few cheesecake variations in
      the past, including my No-Bake Cheesecake, but getting a perfected classic
      version took lots of testing. Finally, here we are.

    <p>
      Oh, and we are skipping the water bath! I’ve always found them to be
      largely unnecessary with cheesecakes. Cook yours on a low temperature and
      follow my tips below and you’ll have a perfectly creamy and crack-less
      cheesecake without all the hassle of a water bath.
